# Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India

## Context
India, being the second-largest country by population with over 1.3 billion people, heavily relies on agriculture as its primary resource. However, the agricultural sector faces numerous challenges, from crop selection to optimizing cultivation practices. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging historical data on agriculture production trends in India (2001-2014).
